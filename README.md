# What is this?
Elyte is a neovim like editor written in C# specifically designed for windows. Elyte on itself does not offer much except the basic syntax highlighting. (It's a "do it yourself" thing.)

There is quite a list of stuff that is missing. And things that probably will never get added. We let Distributions handle everything.
