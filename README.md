# How To Submit Distribution
Open a pull request, i'll look into it.

# Wheres the exe?
Just compile from source. It's really simple with Visual Studio 2022.

# Usage
.\elyte3.exe (INSERT FILE PATH HERE)

# What is this?
Elyte is a neovim like editor written in C# specifically designed for windows. Elyte on itself does not offer much except the basic syntax highlighting. (It's a "do it yourself" thing.)

# What is missing?
There is quite a list of stuff that is missing. And things that probably will never get added. We let Distributions handle everything.
* Saving System
* Backspace on first character line deletion
* Normal Mode
* so on etc.
